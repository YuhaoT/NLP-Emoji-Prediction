# NLP-Emoji-Prediction

By using TF-IDF vectorizer and swap the Spanish emoji index so that the same emoji have the same index for English and Spanish, I built machine learning classifiers that can predict the most possibly associated emoji in a tweet based on 90,000 English tweets and 19,000 Spanish tweets. I also tried to translate Spanish to English and combine the data to see whether the new translated data combined with the original English data as a train set can increase the accuracy.
